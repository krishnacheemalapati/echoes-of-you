# Crime Details: The Assassination of Mayor Elias Vance

## The Victim
Mayor Elias Vance was a powerful, charismatic, and deeply polarizing figure. Renowned for his "Urban Renewal Project," he forcibly displaced thousands from the city's old districts, making him a hero to the elite and a villain to the dispossessed. He also championed the "Truth Serum Justice System" that now holds you.

## The Crime
Mayor Vance was found dead in his heavily secured private office at City Hall. Cause of death: poisoning by a fast-acting neurotoxin, administered via a discreet injection. The time of death is estimated to be between 11:45 PM and 12:15 AM, just after a late-night, unannounced meeting. The office was locked from the inside, and there were no signs of forced entry.

## Your Role (The Accused)
You are a prominent architect and urban planner. Once a supporter of Vance's early projects, you became a vehement critic after your family's ancestral home was demolished for the Urban Renewal Project. You have a public record of opposition, including scathing interviews and a widely shared, emotional rant against Vance two days before the murder.

## Evidence Against You
- **Motive:** Personal vengeance and public condemnation due to the demolition of your family home.
- **Opportunity:** Your old City Hall architect credentials still provided you with rare access. Security logs show your biometric signature at a service entrance during the window of death. The security camera was malfunctioning during this time.
- **Physical Evidence:**
    - A syringe with your partial fingerprint was found near Vance's desk.
    - Pheromone residue from your allergy spray was found on the office doorknob.
    - A confidential blueprint (your preferred brand) is missing from Vance's desk.
- **Witness Testimony:**
    - A janitor saw you on the 10th floor before the camera malfunction.
    - A journalist claims you spoke of "tearing down" Vance's legacy.
    - The Mayor's assistant heard Vance arguing with a familiar visitor during the time of death.
- **Lack of Alibi:** You have amnesia and cannot recall your actions during the critical timeframe.

## Sample Leading Questions for Interrogation
- "Your personal vendetta against Mayor Vance is well-known. Can you explain the depths of your animosity towards him?"
- "Security logs place you inside City Hall during the exact timeframe of Mayor Vance's death. What were you doing there so late?"
- "Your public statements indicate you believed Mayor Vance's 'reign' needed to 'end.' Did you mean this literally?"
- "Your biometric signature was detected at the service entrance, and the camera 'malfunctioned' specifically when you were inside. Coincidence, or careful planning?"
- "The syringe containing the neurotoxin bears your partial fingerprint. Given your architectural background, do you have any knowledge of chemical compounds or their effects?"
- "Explain the presence of your unique allergy spray pheromones on the Mayor's private office doorknob. Were you trying to conceal your presence, or was this a mere oversight in your meticulous planning?"
- "A confidential blueprint went missing from Vance's desk. As an architect, would such a document be valuable to you in your efforts to 'tear down' his legacy?"
- "Commander Thorne implemented this very Truth Serum Justice System. What do you suppose it reveals about your truth, given the overwhelming evidence?"
